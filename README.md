# Simple Stopwatch using Provider and the BLoC pattern.

A simple example of using Provider with the BLoC pattern.

This example uses the Provider package for DI and the BLoC
pattern for state management. The BLoC in this example follows the
rules stating that all input and output from a BLoC must be via streams
and sinks: no functions are allowed. See this talk from Dart Conf 2018
